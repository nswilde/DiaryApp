# DiaryApp

This is my Diary App project to help people keep track of how things were going on a particular day, 
with an emphasis on mental health journaling so that people can maintain healthy routines and reflect on relapses.
    
the goal of this project is to store entries in a way that can be presented to a professional for help managing disabilities and health problems.
